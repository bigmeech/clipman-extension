   <p>Many of today’s tech giants got started with 1 or 2 programmers and went on to become captains of industry riding the wave of the information revolution. Larry Page and Sergey Brin started Google as a graduate student research project. Woz built and programmed the original Apple I computer in his spare time while working at HP. Zuckerberg and Gates started their respective software companies as undergraduate Harvard students.</p>
    <p>Elon Musk, who now heads companies that manufacture rockets & cars, first made his millions on a web application he initially wrote independently in 1995. He didn’t have the capital to go out and start SpaceX or Tesla right out of college because these industries have such high barriers of entry and high marginal costs for each new customer.</p>
    <p>These technologists are the modern paragons of the American Dream. Everyone wants to take their shot at riches, and programming is a skill that provides one with a lot of creative leverage to do so.</p>
