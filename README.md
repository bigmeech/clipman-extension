### Intro
This repo contains codebase for clipman chrome extension.

### About Clipman

It is a chrome tool that enhances the way you copy and paste content when working on the browser. You can switch between tabs copying as much content as you want and store them in an unlimited number of clipboards.

### Features

- Create as many clipboard spaces as you want on demand.
- Navigate clipboard spaces with simple intuitive shortcuts
- Assign the clipboard switcher UI a custom shortcut.
- New copy commands do not have to overwrite the clipboard with new data (They are just queued for pasting later on)
